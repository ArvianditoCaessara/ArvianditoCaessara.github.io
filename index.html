            <p id="about-paragraph">Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose medium is sound. 
                General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody 
                and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics 
                (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes 
                termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, 
                de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments 
                and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, 
                solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine 
                singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").
